	How to write program for Fibonacci ?

	first of all, need to understand how fibonacci works.. what is the algorithm 
	or formula for that..

	Addition of previous two number and printing that addition in the third variable
	is nothing but the fibonacci..

	0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21
	
	this is the example of fibonacci..

	sum of previous two numbers..

	1. Take two variables with default value 0 and 1
	2. Now, take another variable, as third variable to store the sum of two numbers
	3. Take one for loop to process till last value
	4. print numbers and swap variables

	note: There are many ways to get Fibonacci.. I've done with default values(hardcoded)
			and gave input from user(using scanner())
